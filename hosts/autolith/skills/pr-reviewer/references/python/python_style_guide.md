# Python Style Guide Reference

Use the project's configured tools, conventions, and library versions. The examples below draw on Google Python Style Guide and PEP 8; they are contextual review aids, not a mandatory toolchain or style profile.

Focus review on judgment and demonstrated consequences. Formatting, import ordering, annotation completeness, and other mechanical rules belong in actual tool configuration. References to Ruff or basedpyright apply only when those checks are configured; use check-only modes and report their actual results. Do not assume a named tool covers a rule that the project has not enabled.

## 1. Imports — What Ruff Won't Catch

Ruff handles ordering, unused imports, deprecated typing imports, and `Optional` → union rewrites.

**Reviewer must check:**
- Import modules, not individual symbols (exception: `typing`, `collections.abc`) [Google 2.2]
- Absolute imports only — no relative imports [Google 2.3]
- `TYPE_CHECKING` imports go inside `if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:` block — not at top level
- Aliases only for standard abbreviations (`np`, `pd`) — don't alias to obscure origin

```python
# Good
from __future__ import annotations

import os
from collections.abc import Sequence

import httpx
from pydantic import BaseModel

from myproject.models import User

# Bad — hiding origin
from myproject.services.user_management import UserService as US
```

---

## 2. Naming — Semantic Quality

Ruff enforces case conventions (N8xx). Reviewers catch **meaning** problems:

**Red flags:**
- Type-encoding: `user_dict` → `users`, `name_str` → `name`
- Abbreviations by deleting letters: `msg` is fine, `usr`, `cfg`, `mgr` are not
- Shadowing builtins: `list`, `type`, `id`, `input`, `format`, `hash`
- Vague names: `data`, `result`, `info`, `temp`, `stuff` — name the *what*
- Boolean names that don't read as questions: `active` → `is_active`
- Exception classes missing `Error` suffix

---

## 3. Type Annotations — Design Decisions

basedpyright catches missing annotations and type errors. Reviewers catch **design** issues:

### Accept Broad, Return Narrow
```python
# Good — caller can pass any sequence
def process(items: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]: ...

# Bad — unnecessarily restrictive
def process(items: list[str]) -> list[str]: ...
```

Use `Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Iterable` in parameters. Return concrete types.

### Self for Fluent APIs
```python
from typing import Self

class Builder:
    def set_name(self, name: str) -> Self:
        self._name = name
        return self
```

### Always Parameterize Generics
```python
cache: dict[str, list[int]] = {}   # Good
cache: dict = {}                    # Bad — implicit Any, basedpyright may miss
```

---

## 4. Docstrings — Content Quality

Ruff checks presence and format. Reviewers check **content**:

```python
def fetch_users(
    role: Role,
    *,
    active_only: bool = True,
    limit: int = 100,
) -> list[User]:
    """Fetch users matching the given role.

    Queries the user service with pagination. Results are cached
    for 60 seconds per role.

    Args:
        role: The role to filter by.
        active_only: If True, exclude deactivated accounts.
        limit: Maximum number of users to return.

    Returns:
        Users sorted by creation date, newest first.
        Empty list if no matches.

    Raises:
        ServiceUnavailableError: If the user service is down
            after all retry attempts.
    """
```

**Key judgment calls:**
- Summary line uses imperative mood ("Fetch users" not "Fetches users")
- `Args:` omits type info when annotations are present (no redundancy)
- `Returns:` describes *semantics* beyond what the type says (ordering, emptiness behavior)
- `Raises:` only lists exceptions *callers should handle* — not `TypeError` from wrong args
- `@property` described as attribute: `"""The user's display name."""`
- Comments explain *why*, never *what*

---

## 5. Function and Class Design

### Functions
- Keep responsibilities and control flow clear. Extract helpers when they clarify a domain operation, isolate effects, or separate validation; length alone is not a reason to decompose.
- All branches return explicitly (no implicit `None` mixed with real values)
- Use `*` for keyword-only args when 3+ optional params:
  ```python
  def connect(host: str, port: int, *, ssl: bool = True, timeout: float = 30.0): ...
  ```

### Nested Functions
- Only when closing over a local variable (not `self`/`cls`)
- Otherwise, `_private` module-level function — keeps it testable [Google 2.6]

### Class Design
- Choose a static method or module-level function based on the project's API organization and compatibility needs
- `@classmethod` only for alternative constructors (`from_dict`, `from_csv`)
- `@property` for computed/derived attributes only — don't wrap trivially private attrs
- Expensive operations never behind `@property` — callers expect cheap access

---

## 6. Error Handling — Judgment Calls

Ruff catches bare excepts and missing `from` in re-raises. Reviewers catch:

```python
# Good — specific, informative, preserves context
try:
    user = await fetch_user(user_id)
except httpx.TimeoutException:
    raise ServiceUnavailableError(
        f"User service timeout for {user_id}"
    ) from None
except httpx.HTTPStatusError as exc:
    if exc.response.status_code == 404:
        return None
    raise
```

**Judgment calls:**
- Is the `try` block minimal? Large try blocks mask unrelated errors
- Does `raise ... from None` intentionally suppress the chain, or accidentally?
- Are error messages actionable? Include context (IDs, paths, states)
- Is `except Exception` with re-raise genuinely needed, or too broad?
- Never `assert` for validation — stripped with `-O` flag [Google 2.4]
- Never `return`/`break`/`continue` in `finally` — silently cancels exceptions

---

## 7. Pydantic Patterns

### Pydantic v2 API (only for projects targeting v2)

Confirm that the receiver is a Pydantic model and that the project requires v2 before proposing these changes. Preserve intentional `pydantic.v1` compatibility. Method names such as `.dict()` and class names such as `Config` alone do not establish library usage or a defect.
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field, field_validator

class CreateUserRequest(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(strict=True)

    name: str = Field(min_length=1, max_length=255)
    email: str = Field(pattern=r"^[\w.+-]+@[\w-]+\.[\w.]+$")
    role: Role = Role.USER
    tags: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list, max_length=10)

    @field_validator("name")
    @classmethod
    def strip_name(cls, v: str) -> str:
        return v.strip()
```

**v1 → v2 flags (not caught by linters):**
- `class Config:` → `model_config = ConfigDict(...)`
- `.dict()` → `model_dump()`
- `.parse_obj()` → `model_validate()`
- `.schema()` → `model_json_schema()`
- `@validator` → `field_validator`
- `@root_validator` → `model_validator`

### Right Tool for the Job
| Use case | Tool |
|----------|------|
| API input/output, external data | `pydantic.BaseModel` |
| Internal data containers | `dataclasses.dataclass` |
| Immutable value objects | `@dataclass(frozen=True)` or `NamedTuple` |
| Settings/config | `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings` |
| Simple enums | `enum.Enum` / `StrEnum` |

**Flag:** pydantic models used for purely internal data that never crosses a boundary.

## 8. Async — Concurrency Mistakes

Ruff catches blocking calls in async code (`ASYNC1xx`). Reviewers catch:

```python
# Bad — sequential when concurrent is possible
user = await fetch_user(user_id)
perms = await fetch_permissions(user_id)
prefs = await fetch_preferences(user_id)

# Good — concurrent independent operations
user, perms, prefs = await asyncio.gather(
    fetch_user(user_id),
    fetch_permissions(user_id),
    fetch_preferences(user_id),
)
```

**Judgment calls:**
- Are sequential awaits actually independent? (gather them)
- Are task results checked? Fire-and-forget loses errors silently
- Is `asyncio.run()` used only at the entry point?
- Are connections/sessions cleaned up with async context managers?

---

## 9. Security — Easy to Miss

Ruff catches some security issues (S-rules), but these require human review:

- **Path traversal:** `Path.resolve()` + prefix check before file operations with user input
- **JWT:** expiration set, `algorithms=["HS256"]` explicitly specified (default accepts `none`)
- **Session cookies:** `httponly=True`, `secure=True`, `samesite='Strict'` — all three
- **External requests:** timeouts always set (httpx, requests, aiohttp)
- **Logging:** sensitive data never logged (passwords, tokens, PII, credit cards)
- **Input validation:** every system boundary uses pydantic or explicit checks
- **Deserialization:** `pickle.loads()` / `yaml.load()` with untrusted input

---

## 10. Testing — Quality, Not Just Presence

CI catches missing tests and failures. Reviewers catch **quality**:

- **Names describe behavior:** `test_create_user_with_duplicate_email_raises_conflict`
- **Assertions are specific:** `assert result.status == "active"` not `assert result`
- **Exception testing uses match:** `pytest.raises(ValidationError, match="email")`
- **Parametrize for variants** — don't copy-paste the same test with different inputs
- **Fixtures over setup/teardown** — composition over inheritance
- **Mock external deps only** — never mock the unit under test
- **Tests cover the *why*:** if a bug fix, the test should fail without the fix

---

## 11. Performance — Patterns That Look Fine But Aren't

- **Sequential awaits** on independent operations (see Async section)
- **N+1 queries** — loading related objects in a loop instead of eager/batch load
- **String concatenation in loops** — `+=` in loop vs `"".join()`
- **List where set works** — membership testing on large collections
- **Missing timeouts** on external calls — can hang indefinitely
- **Generators ignored** — building full list when caller only needs iteration
